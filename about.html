        <h4>Christopher D. Powers, Owner of Powers Photos</h4>
        <p>
          Chris Powers wears many hats: U.S. Navy veteran, volunteer firefighter,
          and heavy equipment operator. But the role he is most passionate about
          in life is photographer. Chris became interested in photography through
          an introductory course at community college. His first tools of the
          trade were a second-hand single reflex camera, some Kodak Tri-X film,
          and all the darkroom room time he could schedule. Since then, Chris has
          traded up to a Canon EOS 60D digital SLR and an iPhone 8.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          During his 20 years on active duty with the Navy, Chris had the
          opportunity to not only travel the world several times over, but also
          capture images that represented the diversity of cultures across the
          globe. This was especially true when he spent time in the Pacific Rim
          while serving in locations such as Japan, Hong Kong, Thailand, and
          Australia. By portraying the people and places of the communities he
          visited, Chris developed his signature style that features an
          asymmetrical, yet dynamic composition, a pungent sense of color, and a
          dramatic contrast of dark and light. Chris is particularly well known
          for his images of natural landscapes, tourist destinations, and
          cityscapes at night.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The "postcard quality" of Chris' work has drawn admirers throughout his
          many years of travels. While most of his photography arises through a
          spontaneous process, Chris will also create images for clients by
          private commission. If you would like Chris to create some photographs
          for you or craft a print from his current collection of images, please
          contact him at
